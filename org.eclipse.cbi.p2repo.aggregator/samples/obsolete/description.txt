These "obsolete" samples are obviously from long ago and no longer work. 

They have been left here in the repository as a reminder that someone 
should update them to be current or write new ones that demonstrate the same 
principle, and then the "Manual Wiki" at 
https://wiki.eclipse.org/CBI/aggregator/manual
updated to point to the new example.
