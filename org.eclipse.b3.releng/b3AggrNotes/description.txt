This folder contains notes, probably temporary about "what I found", 
when looking at the existing project, especally at the existing p2 repositories 
at 

 http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/emft/b3/updates-4.4/
 
 and 
 
  http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/emft/b3/headless-4.4/

  
The goal being any new build we create will contain the same bundles and features.
